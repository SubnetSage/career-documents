* [DMVPN Lab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CzoBaKl0VbGjE7f5gZ6ajKbZXQFzVtK1/view)
* [MPLS Redesign](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ndLxm_BNKybuQ4_2uJR5vJj0JzZIox6x/view)
* [MPLS Wireshark Packet Capture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lgHbTukFRe3kpf2ZF1u3slM03LRosPfh/view)
* [OSPF Authentication Verification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-U-el0tCcrC-NvGUo_44ta3jlUHo3Y1x/view)
* Built Python automation scripts using Netmiko to streamline multi-device management across Cisco environments. The toolkit connects to multiple routers and switches, pulls real-time CDP neighbor data, updates interface descriptions, removes outdated banners, and backs up running configurations — all with a single command.
* Used AI to analyze and interpret traceroute output from a lab environment, breaking down each hop across core routers, service provider paths, MPLS segments, and external networks. This workflow demonstrated how AI can support faster, clearer understanding of end-to-end network paths and assist in troubleshooting.

## AI Projects

Projects focused on open-source AI, infrastructure, and applied LLM development.

* [Open Source AI Development](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11RVJ0umDgQe6p7axi3kQ3Ty1OfRbJ4aU/view)
* Designed and deployed a multi-server, GPU-accelerated AI environment using open-source LLMs, supporting fine-tuning workflows and REST API integrations for production use.
* Python automation (file operations, directory monitoring, JSON config systems), Google Drive API integration & service account authentication, REST API consumption, Cloud GPU environment workflow automation, Cloud file synchronization & automated backup pipelines, DevOps-style scripting and workflow orchestration, Secure credential and secrets handling
