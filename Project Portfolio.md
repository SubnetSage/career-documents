# Technical Project Portfolio

## 🤖 Featured AI & Automation Projects

### **Content-as-a-Service (CaaS) Platform**

**Role:** Lead System Architect & AI Orchestrator

**Tech Stack:** n8n, Supabase, Lovable, PostgreSQL, Gemini/OpenAI API, ElevenLabs

**[Link to Repository (Coming Soon)]**

* **Project Scope:** Architected a vertical SaaS platform that automates the end-to-end production of high-fidelity social media content (Shorts, LinkedIn posts, X threads).
* **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Developed a proprietary development framework using six specialized AI Agents (**Apex, Sentinel, Vanguard, Cipher, Beacon, and The Skeptic**) to manage distinct lifecycles of the product, from database schema design to security auditing.
* **Core Loop Engine:** Built a robust synchronization layer where **Lovable** (Frontend) triggers **n8n** (Workflow Engine) via **Supabase** webhooks for seamless transition from ingestion to AI processing.
* **Security & Monetization:** Deployed strict Row-Level Security (RLS) policies and a "Markup Model" billing system that tracks real-time token usage and processing costs.

### **MPLS Lab Designer**

**[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SubnetSage/MPLS-Lab-Fabric-Config-Generator)**

* **Technical Achievement:** Built a dynamic MPLS L3VPN network design generator using Python and Streamlit.
